dotfiles
========

My personal dotfiles. I do a few weird things, but the most notable are the `k*` package aliases,
(`ki`, `kr`, `ks`, etc.) which make package installation use the same very short commands on
basically any distribution. Additionally, the related `pk*` aliases (`pki`, `pkr`, `pks`, and `pkl`)
which allow easy installing of Python packages to the right place, whether that's within my home folder
or in the system-wide installation folder.
